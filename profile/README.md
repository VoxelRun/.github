## Hello dear Programmers

### Who are we?
We are a group of programmers which would like to build a Voxel game in Rust without relying on the bare minimum of dependencies in Rust.

### Contribution Guidelines
- All Contributions must be checked by cargo fmt, and pass all test cases defined in the crates.
- All Contributions must include tests that verify the functionality of the code.
- All Contributions must include sufficient documentation via rustdoc in Rust code. If the code is doing something not decipherable by just reading it, add explanatory comments.
